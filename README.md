# University Dormitory Management System

## 📌 About the Project
Our project is a University Dormitory Management System, designed to efficiently manage student accommodations within university dormitories. It provides a structured way to handle room reservations, student information, dormitory capacity, complaints, and administrative tasks. The system ensures a seamless interaction between students and the university administration, improving housing allocation and response to student concerns.


## 🎯 Features
Student Registration & Management: Store student details, including name, date of birth, and university information.
Room Reservation System: Allow students to book rooms based on availability.
Dormitory & Room Management: Manage dormitory (foyer), blocks, and rooms (single, double, triple).
Complaint & Response Handling: Students can submit complaints, and administrators can provide responses.
University & Dormitory Integration: Each dormitory is linked to a university for structured housing management.
