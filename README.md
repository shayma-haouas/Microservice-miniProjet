📚 Project Description
This project is built using a microservices architecture, consisting of two main services:

🔐 Microservice: UserStudent
This service is responsible for managing users (students) and includes the following key features:

Authentication: Implemented using two different methods:

Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token)

OAuth 2.0 using Keycloak

User Management:

Display the list of users

Filter users based on their status (verified, blocked, etc.)

Generate user-related statistics

PDF Contract Generation:

Ability to generate a customized contract in PDF format for each user.

🎉 Microservice: Evenement
This service handles event-related functionality and is built using a different technology than Spring Boot, demonstrating the interoperability and flexibility of the microservices architecture.
(e.g., Node.js, Express, or any other – specify here based on your implementation.)
