# 🏫 University Dormitory Management System

## 📌 About the Project

Our project is a **University Dormitory Management System**, designed to efficiently manage student accommodations within university dormitories. It provides a structured way to handle room reservations, student information, dormitory capacity, complaints, and administrative tasks. The system ensures a seamless interaction between students and the university administration, improving housing allocation and response to student concerns.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Concepts

The system is built using a **Microservices Architecture**, providing modularity, scalability, and ease of maintenance. Key technologies include:

- **Spring Boot / Node.js** – Backend service development  
- **Angular** – Frontend framework for a dynamic and responsive UI  
- **API Gateway** – Routing and load balancing for microservices  
- **Eureka (Service Discovery)** – Helps services locate each other  
- **Spring Cloud Config Server** – Centralized configuration for all microservices  
- **Keycloak & Spring Security** – Authentication and role-based access control  
- **Kafka / RabbitMQ** – Asynchronous communication between services (optional)  
- **SQL / NoSQL Databases** – For persistent data storage depending on service needs  
- **Docker / Kubernetes** – Containerization and orchestration for deployment
